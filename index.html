                The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite <br> sex is something that runs deep within
                everyone, even <br> though most people don't take the time to find someone <br> who truly respects them.
                It seems like people are just <br> looking for people to show them the slightest amount of <br>
                attention, settling for something much less than respect. I <br>am convinced one of the best ways to
                help any relationship<br> grow is by showing respect.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be <br> respected. What is respect? Respect is
                showing someone <br> extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to <br> show them how
                highly they are
                valued.
